                   Release of version 0.62 of Inline::Files
==============================================================================


NAME
    Inline::File - Multiple virtual files at the end of your code

SYNOPSIS

    use Inline::Files;

    my Code $here;

    while (<FOO>) { print }

    # etc.

    __FOO__
    This is a virtual file at the end
    of the data
        
    __BAR__
    This is another
    virtual

    file
    __FOO__
    This is yet another 
    such file

DESCRIPTION
    Inline::Files generalizes the notion of the `__DATA__' marker and the
    associated `<DATA>' filehandle, to an arbitrary number of markers and
    associated filehandles.

    When you add the line:

            use Inline::Files;

    to a source file you can then specify an arbitrary number of
    distinct virtual files at the end of the code.
